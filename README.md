# indigo-tesla-plugin
Plugin for [Indigo home automation software][indigo] to support Tesla Motors Model S & X API.

### Known Limitations
* Only supports a single Tesla per login account
* The plugin only updates once a minute; this is to avoid causing heavy usage on the Tesla API endpoint.

In case you haven't figured it out, nothing works yet...

This wouldn't be possible without work from people who know a whole lot more than I do:
